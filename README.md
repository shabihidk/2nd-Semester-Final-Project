# SignatureClusterTool

A desktop-based clustering and visualization tool that processes datasets, calculates correlation matrices, and uses discretization and permutation techniques to visually identify clusters. Built using Object-Oriented Programming principles and C++ with the FireMonkey (FMX) framework.

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 **Correlation Analysis**: Computes Pearson correlation coefficients between data rows.
- ⚙️ **Discretization**: Transforms correlation matrices into binary matrices based on mean thresholding.
- 🖼️ **Visualization**: Displays matrices as zoomable bitmap images for pattern analysis.
- 🔀 **Permutation & Signature Clustering**: Shuffles data and recovers cluster structure using a signature-based technique.
- 🧠 **Image-Based Insights**: Shows color-coded cluster visuals pre- and post-signature transformation.

## 🛠️ How to Run

> 🛑 Prerequisite: Embarcadero C++ Builder (with FMX support)

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `.cbproj` file in C++ Builder.
3. Run the project.
4. Load a dataset (formatted rows of numerical data).
5. Choose between Task 1 (basic clustering) or Task 2 (signature-based permutation clustering).

## 📸 Sample Outputs


### 🟦 Original Correlation Matrix

This matrix is generated by computing Pearson’s correlation between all rows in the dataset.

### 🔀 Permuted Matrix (Before Clustering)

After shuffling the rows, structural patterns are lost — this simulates unordered or noisy data input.

### 🔁 Clustered Matrix (After Signature Technique)

Using the signature technique, row patterns are recovered and reordered to reveal underlying clusters.

## 📌 Notes

- All memory is cleaned using dynamic deallocation.
- Signature clustering improves visual grouping of hidden clusters.
- Future plans: add CSV input, dynamic thresholding, and improved image scaling.
